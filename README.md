This project is part of the Flying Car Nano Degree from Udacity.

I had to set up a state machine using event-driven programming to autonomously flying a drone. Udacity provided a Unity simulator to fly the quadcopter. By completing this assignment, I got familiar with sending commands and receiving incoming data from the drone. 

To checkout my solution you may follow the next steps

## Step 1: Download the Simulator
You may find the simulator in [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Simulator-Releases/releases).

## Step 2: Set up your Python Environment
To set up your Python environment and get all the relevant packages installed using Anaconda take a look at [this repository](https://github.com/udacity/FCND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

## Step 3: Clone this Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/StefanThaenert/FCND_Backyard_flyer.git
```

## Step 4: try it
By running backyard_flyer.py you may run the code.
At the top of backyard_flyer.py you may play around with these 3 parameters:

hover=1         # time to hover in [s] in certain position
corner = 10.0   # distance in [m] to corner of square
height = 3.5    # altitude in [m] for flying

So have some fun trying it.
